# Introduction

This backend system allows users to register, browse available restaurants, place food orders, and track their order statuses in real-time. Restaurants can manage their menu and orders, and the system provides real-time updates to users on order progress. The project is built using JWT for authentication and WebSockets for real-time order updates.

# Motivation

The goal behind building this project was to design and implement a scalable backend system for a food delivery platform. This project helped improve skills in backend development, system architecture design, real-time updates, and scalability similar to platforms like Zomato.

# Problem Solved

This backend platform simplifies food delivery services by providing a seamless system for users to browse restaurants, place orders, and track deliveries. Restaurants can manage their menus and update order statuses, ensuring smooth communication between users, delivery agents, and restaurant staff.

# Tech Stack

• Backend: Node.js, Express.js
• Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
• Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
• Real-time Communication: WebSockets
• Languages: JavaScript/TypeScript

# Features

• User Management
   • Register and login users.
   • Manage profiles and delivery addresses.
• Restaurant and Menu Management
    • Add, update, and manage restaurant details and menus.
• Order Placement and Management
    • Place orders from restaurant menus, view order statuses, and track orders.
• Real-Time Order Tracking
    • WebSockets for real-time updates on order progress (Pending, Confirmed, In Progress, Out for Delivery, Delivered).

# Challenges & Learnings

Challenges Faced
• Real-Time Tracking: Ensuring scalability and performance with real-time order updates using WebSockets.
• Scalability: Maintaining performance while handling multiple concurrent users and orders.
• Security: Implementing secure data validation and JWT-based authentication.

# Learnings

• Gained insights into designing real-time systems with NoSQL databases.
• Enhanced understanding of WebSocket performance for high traffic volumes.
• Improved knowledge in securing backend systems with JWT authentication.

# Future Improvements

• Enhanced Order Tracking: GPS integration to track delivery agents in real-time.
• Recommendation System: Add recommendations based on user preferences and past orders.
• Rating System: Implement a review system for restaurants and menu items.
• Payment Gateway Integration: Add third-party payment gateways for secure transactions.

## API Documentation
# User Management

• Register a New User: POST /register
• Login User: POST /login
• Get Profile: GET /profile (JWT required)
• Update Profile: PUT /profile (JWT required)Update 
• Profile: PUT /profile (JWT required)

# Restaurant Management

• Create Restaurant: POST /restaurants
• Update Restaurant: PUT /restaurants/{restaurantId}
• Add Menu Item: POST /restaurants/{restaurantId}/menu
• Update Menu Item: PUT /restaurants/{restaurantId}/menu/{itemId}

# Order Management

• Place a New Order: POST /orders
• Get Order Details: GET /orders/{orderId} (JWT required)
• Update Order Status: PUT /orders/{orderId}/status
• Get All Orders for User: GET /orders (JWT required)

# Real-Time Functionality

The project uses WebSockets to provide real-time updates on the progress of orders. Users can subscribe to order status updates via WebSocket connections and receive notifications as the order moves through different stages (Pending, In Progress, Out for Delivery, Delivered).

# Scalability and Performance
Database Optimization: Indexed critical fields (e.g., email for users, order status) to improve query performance.

# Horizontal Scaling :
 Supports scaling across multiple server instances and database sharding.

# Real-Time Updates:
 WebSockets are scaled using Redis Pub/Sub for message distribution across distributed systems.

# Error Handling

• Input Validation: All user inputs are validated for correct format and required fields.
• Authentication: JWT-based authentication ensures only authenticated users can access specific routes.
• Error Responses: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages are returned for validation errors, unauthorized access, and server errors.

# Deployment

To deploy the application, ensure you have a MongoDB instance running and that the .env file is set up correctly. You can deploy the application using services like Heroku, AWS, or any other cloud platform that supports Node.js applications.
